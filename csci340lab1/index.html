                <h3><li>Size<img id="size" src="images/people.jpg"></li></h3>
                <p> One key element to keep in mind when orgainzing a crowd of people is projected number of people showing up. When orgainzing a crowd you want to find an appropriate place that can hold a desired amount of people. Try to avoid having a huge crowd of people if the venue is small and likewise try to avoid having a small crowd in an overly spacious location.</p>
                <h3><li>Occasion<img id="occasion" src="images/party.jpg"></li></h3>
                <p>Another element to keep in mind is the occasion in which you are organizing these people together. If the occasion calls for more serious matters try to find a place that is free from many distractions to allow for everyone to fully engaged. However, if it is less serious you can allow for more outside distrations as there is no need to keep everyones attention the entire time.</p>
                <h3><li>Budget<img id="budget" src="images/scale.jpg"></li></h3>
                <p>The last big element to keep in mind is the amount of money that is going to be put forth. Funds are what makes everything possible be it there is grand amount or a minimal amount. There is nothing that is stopping even the most cost effecient organizing of a crowd from being a huge success or even the most extravagant from being a flop.</p>
