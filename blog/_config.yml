  In the every changing rollercoaster of life this blog is to highlight some 
  of the day to day things that I go through. It will highlight the parts of my
  life that are great challenges I faced, awesome adventures that I got to 
  experience, the small and little joys that come at random moments, and even 
  the frustarions I have. This will be a place that any thing on my mind will 
  have a safe space to live and be shared amongst any who stumble upon it too.
